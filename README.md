# RNGesus, a Mod for Battletech

May it's seed be sufficiently random.

May it's generation be unbiased and even.

May it's distribution tested and known.

May we all suffer the same discipline of unweighted judgement.

May your chances be unencumbered by psychology or perspective.

The RNG wilst granteth and denyeth, the RNG wilst giveth and taketh.

Render yourself unto the mercy of the RNG pure and true. :balance_scale:

## Foreword

BattleTech has a good and just MurmurHash3 based RNG,
but corrections are applied to your rolls, meaning the
chances you see are not the chances you actually get.
These corrected odds affect you, the AI and other players.
There's also streak breaking involved. There are even
ways to game the system such that you are able to get a
100% chance to hit by intentionally taking poorer shots.

Some argue that there's a good reason (psychology) that
makes these corrections a good thing. Many point to XCom,
and it's justification of altering the odds. However, the
same argument seems to apply whether the results are skewed
for or against the player. I argue it's dishonest at best,
heretical at worst.

This mod uses the community supported [BattleTech Mod Loader](btml)!
Support the [BattleTech modding effort on reddit](btml-reddit).


## Installing

Install the BattleTech Mod Loader first,
instructions [here on reddit](btml-reddit).

Place `RNGesus.dll` into the `\BATTLETECH\Mods\` folder.

Enjoy the uncorrected RNG and remember to praise RNGesus!

## The Future

This mod will eventually incorporate a facility to allow
toggling of RNG modes, including triangular, gaussian,
and original bias.
